## Predict The Conversion Rate of Customers through Online channels and Advertisement üì±
This project is to create and evaluate a model that can predict the likelihood of a user performing an online purchase for a website, depending on the amount of ads shown, time it was shown, type of advert e.t.c
The dataset is highly imbalanced as people generally are highly averted to Ads of any kind. It has about 550,000 entries
#### Variables:
- UserId: The unique identifier for each user  
- test group: This is the assignment for users in an A/B Test(ad: shown an ad/psa: shown a public service announcement)
- total ads: the total number of ads a user was shown during the experiment  
- Most ads day: the day of the week the user was shown the most ads
- Most Ads hour: hour of the day in 24hr format when the user saw the most ads

 #### Target Variable
- converted: This indicates whether a user made a purchase through the ad

#### Techniques Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Variety of Data Visualisation models
-  Functions for Modularity
-  Statistical A/B Testing
-  Oversampling and Undersampling
-  Learning Curve
-  Feature Importance assumed by the model
#### Models Trained
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier

#### Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- Confusion Matrix
